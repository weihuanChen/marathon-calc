    "questions": {
      "0": {
        "question": "How does this calculator work?",
        "answer": "This calculator uses the basic running formula: pace = time ÷ distance. Based on your selected mode, it calculates the unknown value from the other two known values. All calculations happen in real-time."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "What does pace mean?",
        "answer": "Pace is the time required per kilometer (or mile), typically displayed in 'minutes'seconds'' format. For example, 5'30'' means 5 minutes and 30 seconds per kilometer. Lower pace means faster running."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "How do I switch between metric and imperial?",
        "answer": "Click the unit toggle button (with the cycle icon) in the top-right of the input area to switch between metric (km) and imperial (mi). All values will convert automatically."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "What are split times?",
        "answer": "The split times table shows cumulative time at each kilometer (or mile) marker throughout your run. This is useful for planning race pacing strategies."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "What do the colors on the rings represent?",
        "answer": "The central pace indicator's color changes based on pace intensity: cool colors (blue, cyan) indicate easy pace, warm colors (orange, red) indicate fast pace. This helps you quickly assess training intensity."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Can I drag the rings?",
        "answer": "Yes! Both distance and time rings are draggable. Click and drag the progress bar on the ring to adjust values in real-time. It's a fun way to explore different pace combinations."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "What distances does the calculator support?",
        "answer": "You can enter any distance, or use the preset buttons for common distances: 5K, 10K, Half Marathon (21.0975 km), Marathon (42.195 km), and 50K."
